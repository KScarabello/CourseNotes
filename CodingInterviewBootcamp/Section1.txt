Contact phase/Interview phase

Contact: the phase where you make contact with a company
    -via recruiter/LinkedIn/submitting a resume

Interview phase:
    -phone screens/take home projects/interviews

What is the average company looking to evaluate?
    According to Grider:
        -Contact phase -general idea of who you are? Work experience, side projects, do you know anyone at the company?
        -Interview phase - culture fit, whether you are effective coder

One make or break quality is coding interview questions - the single most important quality you will be evaluated on. 
    ** overrides every other quality **

This is usually done with take-home assignments, pair-programming with an interviewer, and whiteboarding,
    -whiteboarding is common among large companies

How do you get better at whiteboarding?
    PRACTICE!!!
